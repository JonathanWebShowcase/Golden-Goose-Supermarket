## Project Overview

This project was a school assignment aimed at deepening my understanding of backend development fundamentals. The goal was to recreate my original website from a previous web design class, showcasing my growth and proficiency in backend technologies. The project focused on implementing core concepts learned in the database fundamentals and backend development courses, particularly emphasizing the use of MySQL and PHP to generate dynamic web pages based on user data.

## Process

The development process involved applying the principles of MySQL and PHP to create a dynamic website. I integrated the PDO (PHP Data Objects) method throughout the project to ensure robust security and prevent SQL injection attacks. The work began with analyzing the requirements and designing a schema that would effectively handle user data. I then developed the backend logic to interact with the database, allowing for dynamic content generation based on user interactions and inputs.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring the security of user data against SQL injection attacks. To address this, I used the PDO method extensively, which provided a secure way to execute SQL queries. This approach not only protected the application from potential security threats but also reinforced best practices in backend development. Another challenge was replicating and enhancing the features of my original website while incorporating new functionalities learned during the semester. This required careful planning and implementation to ensure that the final product reflected my growth as a developer.

## Lessons Learned

This project highlighted the importance of security in backend development, specifically the need to safeguard against SQL injection. Implementing the PDO method was a crucial learning experience that enhanced my understanding of secure database interactions. Additionally, recreating and improving upon my previous work allowed me to apply new knowledge and skills in a practical context, reinforcing the concepts of dynamic content generation and database management.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated my growth in backend development, showcasing the application of MySQL and PHP in creating a dynamic and secure web environment. By emphasizing security and leveraging the PDO method, I was able to build a robust application that highlighted my progress and understanding of backend fundamentals. This assignment not only reinforced my technical skills but also provided a valuable opportunity to apply classroom knowledge in a real-world context.
